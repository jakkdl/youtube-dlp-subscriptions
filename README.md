# youtube-dlp-subscriptions

Downloads new videos from your YouTube subscription feeds since the last run.


## Changes from upstream
subs.xml placed inside .config/youtube-dlp-subscriptions (though currently hardcoded)
supports custom video directory
instead of a last.txt, it uses yt-dlp's archive file
    todo: probably do this within python for speedup, not needing to limit to recent videos, and have less verbose output
channels can specify name filters on what to include, and custom options passed onto yt-dlp

## Requirements

This script requires python3. Additional dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage (Docker-Compose)
If you are familiar with what docker is, and what docker-compose is to docker, this is the recommended method to use.

Create a `subs.xml` file inside `app/` and populate it with your channels to download from. See `subs.sample.xml` for an example. See "More on subs.xml" chapter below for more info.

First time only: `docker build`

Every subsequnt time: `docker run`

A cron job can be set up to run the process at specified intervals. Be sure to `cd` into the directory first before running `docker run` from cron.

sample:
every day at 2AM, log stdout/stderr to log as well
`0 2 * * * cd /home/darkenvy/git/youtube-dlp-subscriptions && docker-compose up 2>&1 | tee log.txt`

## Usage (Manual)

Clone the repository

    `git clone https://github.com/darkenvy/youtube-dlp-subscriptions`
    `cd youtube-dlp-subscriptions/app/`

Install the requirements

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need to generate an xml file and name it `subs.xml`. See subs.sample.xml for an example. In the past, this file was easily generated, but Google has removed the feature to generate a OMPL file as a means to stop driving traffic away from youtube (and onto newsreaders and the like).

You can then run the script

    python3 dl.py

A `last.txt` file will be created in order to avoid downloading the same videos on the next run.

## More on subs.xml

Start with this initial template:
```
<opml version="1.1">
  <body>
    <outline text="YouTube Subscriptions" title="YouTube Subscriptions">
      <outline title="ANYTHING" type="rss" xmlUrl="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID" />
    </outline>
  </body>
</opml>
```

The ONLY factor that you must change is the string of `CHANNEL_ID`. the text ANYTHING is only for self-comments (and is useful for maintaining a long list ;) ).

## SyncThing
Syncthing can be set up to sync from the downloads folder onto any other device (such as an android). Quite useful for long trips without cellular internet (or a data plan).

## TODO:
Get rid of the XML entirely now that it is no longer a point-of-convenience.
Favor a item list of channel_ids. Perhaps utilize yt-dlp's `-a` flag, which can take a list and download them. `--playlist-end 15` and `--dateafter` are also useful flags.

## Thanks

A thanks to mewfree and https://github.com/mewfree/youtube-dl-subscriptions for the original script and pukkandan for dlp.
